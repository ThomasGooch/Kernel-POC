# AI Agents with Semantic Kernel

This project is a Python-based solution utilizing Semantic Kernel to build AI agents. The development process follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) best practices.

## Features
- AI agent implementation using Semantic Kernel.
- TDD methodology for robust and reliable code.

## Getting Started
1. Install Python (latest version).
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running Tests
Run the following command to execute tests:
```bash
pytest
```

## Contributing
